# Personal website

This is a single page personal website that is written in vanilla CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

The picture in about me section is an old-ish high quality picture of mine that I fiddled with in GIMP.

JavaScript is taking care of Home button appearance, 'click-to-see' divider animation,as well as enabling a slider in Projects section and a credential overlay in Certifications section.

CSS animates background of navigation bar and About Me section.

The page is being actively updated.
